        "csvsafedescrip": "Emulating a trip through Craig's childhood- one machine at a time. Desktop computers today don't have any soul. Sure you have your Linux and your Macintosh and your 'Windows' but it's all pretty much the same hardware underneath. Why not put those gigahertz to use and emulate the hardware and software of yester-year? Craig Maloney will give a tour of his childhood by showing us how to (legally) run such computers as the Atari 800XL- the Commodore Amiga- PET and C64- the Sinclair ZX series- and even some arcade games. Amaze your friends by running a room-full of 1970s and 1980s technology on more capable hardware. It's a presentation you won't want to miss!",

        "csvsafedescrip": "Online backup is incredibly useful- but has many privacy and integrity risks. Tarsnap is an online backup service that only handles your data in encrypted form. It's inexpensive and reliable. Plus you don't need to trust the Tarsnap service--they can't access your backups even if they want to. And Tarsnap's built-in deduplication saves space- letting you store terabytes of backups in mere gigabytes of disk. This talk takes you through using Tarsnap- from backing up a system to customizing and rotating backups- to fully restoring them.",
