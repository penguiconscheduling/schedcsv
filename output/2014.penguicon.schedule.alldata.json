Back here on planet Reality, specialized computers called Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) are what run practically every industrial process - they control machinery to assemble electronics, regulate temperature, blend pharmaceuticals, and do a thousand more things.  In factories, warehouses, ships, and trucks throughout the world, these rugged workhorses are the core of modern industry.  Learn how they work, how to program them, which units have free programming software, and how to score cheap used units on ebay to install in your army of giant Mecha-Hamsters. ",
