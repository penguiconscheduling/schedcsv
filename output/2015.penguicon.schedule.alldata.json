        "csvsafedescrip": "The first Penguicon Chess Tournament has arrived! Bug House games are extremely fast paced team play often involving shouting and some very non-traditional mechanics. Even if you don't play chess- feel free to swing by and take a peak. This tournament will -not- be elimination- so expect to get 4-5 games in. There will be a sign-up sheet at Ops. Chess set availability is limited. Those that bring a set get first priority; second priority goes to those on the sign-up sheet- in order. Equipment: If you have a chess set or durable clock- please bring it. We do have a limited number of sets available for use. You need to know at least one variant of Bug House or Doubles Speed- get introduced at the earlier Learn Bug House event! As long as you understand the rules- don't worry about not being good enough!",

When they found a pair of mystical 6-sided dice- they were transformed into men who couldn't stop rapping. It was terrifying and a little upsetting to everyone involved. Now it's 2015 so strap on your spats and lace 'em tight to prepare for high-energy nerd-themed hip-hop with a lot of hyphenates! 2d6's rhymes are about the geekiest of geek topics: DIY conventions- Boba Fett- Amedeo Avogadro- daikaiju- geek girls- and the like.",
