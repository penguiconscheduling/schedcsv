Singing links the emotion of music with the power of words. In this interactive session- we will learn Vienna Teng's 'Hymn of Axciom-' a poignant tune about digital surveillance- in four-part harmony. Contrary to popular opinion- singing is a learned skill- not just an innate talent. Ashley will share tips and techniques to use your voice and make meaningful music- lessons learned from fifteen years in adult- auditioned choirs. Ability to read music is helpful but not necessary. Listeners are also welcome!",TRUE,PUBLIC,""
