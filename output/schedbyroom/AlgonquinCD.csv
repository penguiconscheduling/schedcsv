After the medical tech industry kept promising a system to help automatically manage insulin for type 1 diabetic people and never delivering- some people got together to find ways to do it with the tech they already had. Over the past few years- a 'closed-loop' system has been developed to algorithmically regulate peoples blood sugars. As a diabetic- the presenter built this system and saw her sugar values stabilize much more than would be possibly by managing them manually. Learn about OpenAPS (the open artificial pancreas system) and how it works- what problems it solves- and its safety and security concerns. The presenter will also share her personal experience and what OpenAPS means for her health now and in the future. Consider how we- as software developers- can change peoples lives through the code we write.",TRUE,PUBLIC,""
