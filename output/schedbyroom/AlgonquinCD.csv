After the medical tech industry kept promising a system to help automatically manage insulin for type 1 diabetic people and never delivering- some people got together to find ways to do it with the tech they already had. Over the past few years- a 'closed-loop' system has been developed to algorithmically regulate peoples blood sugars. As a diabetic- the presenter built this system and saw her sugar values stabilize much more than would be possibly by managing them manually.
