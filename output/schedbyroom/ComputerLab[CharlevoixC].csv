The very common and most interesting result of this workshop is that people realize how strongly they lean towards either dystopian or utopian thinking about the future of technology- which results in an excellent discussion at the end of the workshop.The goal of the workshop is to encourage people to avoid unproductive extremes of utopian/dystopian thinking and adopt a more critically optimistic- balanced approach to thinking about technology and the future.",TRUE,PUBLIC,""
