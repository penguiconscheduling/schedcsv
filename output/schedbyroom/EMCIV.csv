As with every subculture that suddenly finds itself in media spotlight- there are a lot of misconceptions. In this panel and discussion- we will attempt to put stereotypes to rest and remove some of the negative media stigma. Whether this is totally your scene- you know that one guy that does this- or you have no idea- come share your questions and experiences. We will cover the entire spectrum of this fun and interesting subculture (18+ only please).",FALSE,PUBLIC,"none"

Simple design concepts such as tensile strength- Poisson's ratio- and stress risers will be explained and used to demonstrate how to make optimal material- shape- and functional choices.  Particular attention will be paid to the peculiarities of parts made with layers of extruded plastic and destined for the high-stresses imparted on parts destined for use in 3D-printed firearms.",FALSE,PUBLIC,"none"
5/1/2016,12:00,5/1/2016,12:50,50 minutes,"EMC IV","Tech","Better Filesystems with Btrfs","Ryan Kather","Better FS- Butter FS- B-Tree FS?  What is it called- and why should you care about a new filesystem for Linux?  Come learn about the advanced features- design- and use of one of Linux's most exciting new features.  We will also cover how it compares to other filesystems- such as ZFS- and other interesting related topics like bcache.  ",FALSE,PUBLIC,"none"

It is not for game programmers or web designers or anybody who makes anything pretty.  We're all about making things work.",FALSE,PUBLIC,"none"
4/30/2016,11:00,4/30/2016,13:50,2 hours and 50 minutes,"EMC IV","Tech","Keysigning Party","Richard Houser","In this hands-on event- participants will learn how the web of trust model works and perform identify verification with fellow attendees. We will do so in a manner compatible with CAcert.org- so you can use the resulting identify assurance to issue your own free SSL certificates- code signatures- etc. With a little additional work- you can also become an assurer of your own right at Penguicon. We will also exchange OpenPGP keys if you have them- so bring your key fingerprints with you! Participants need to bring at least two forms of ID — at least one of which must be a government issued photo ID showing birthdate. Having your own notebook computer able to output PDFs files greatly simplifies things- too. New users are expected to show up at the start- but returning participants from Penguicon Keysigning events and any CAcert.org assurers may show up one hour in.",FALSE,PUBLIC,"none"
5/1/2016,11:00,5/1/2016,11:50,50 minutes,"EMC IV","Tech","Open Source Maker Apps","Richard Houser","The maker movement has been making headlines- in particular the 3D printer space.  Something that is often overlooked is the state of the software.  Many manufacturers ship closed source software- which is against the spirit of the movement.  We'll go through a quick overview of one 3D printer toolchain (FreeCAD- Slic3r- OctoPrint)- and discuss possible alternatives at each stage.  Other participants are strongly encouraged to bring a laptop running their maker software of choice (OSS only- please!) to share in a 2-5minute show and tell fashion.  Other maker toolchain applications would be particularly welcome (PCB design/circuit simulation- CNC tooling- laser cutters- etc).",FALSE,PUBLIC,"none"
