Simple design concepts such as tensile strength- Poisson's ratio- and stress risers will be explained and used to demonstrate how to make optimal material- shape- and functional choices.  Particular attention will be paid to the peculiarities of parts made with layers of extruded plastic and destined for the high-stresses imparted on parts destined for use in 3D-printed firearms.",FALSE,DEFAULT,"none"

We will do so in a manner compatible with CAcert.org- so you can use the resulting identify assurance to issue your own free SSL certificates- code signatures- etc. With a little additional work- you can also become an assurer of your own right at Penguicon. We will also exchange OpenPGP keys if you have them- so bring your key fingerprints with you! Participants need to bring at least two forms of ID — at least one of which must be a government issued photo ID showing birthdate. Having your own notebook computer able to output PDFs files greatly simplifies things- too. New users are expected to show up at the start- but returning participants from Penguicon Keysigning events and any CAcert.org assurers may show up one hour in.",FALSE,DEFAULT,"none"

Something that is often overlooked is the state of the software.  Many manufacturers ship closed source software- which is against the spirit of the movement.  We'll go through a quick overview of one 3D printer toolchain (FreeCAD- Slic3r- OctoPrint)- and discuss possible alternatives at each stage.  Other participants are strongly encouraged to bring a laptop running their maker software of choice (OSS only- please!) to share in a 2-5minute show and tell fashion.  Other maker toolchain applications would be particularly welcome (PCB design/circuit simulation- CNC tooling- laser cutters- etc).",FALSE,DEFAULT,"none"

That's where our Intro to Coding Workshop- lovingly called  “The Traveling Circus-” comes in. This is designed for folks who are curious about coding- but who have little to no experience. You'll walk away with some programming foundations to start learning on your own!",FALSE,DEFAULT,"none"
