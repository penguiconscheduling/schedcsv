We will teach you how to use this skill to create (or repair) your own electronics projects- and you will get a fancy Penguicon LED badge to prove it! Already have a fancy LED badge? Make it better! We will provide microcontroller programmers for those who wish to change their badge's microcontroller code.  Write programs in AVR C to fashion new blinky badge sequences- or create a simple badge-based game!",FALSE,PUBLIC,"none"
