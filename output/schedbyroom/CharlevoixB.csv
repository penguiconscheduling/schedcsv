The reason it's stalling is that its job is successfully finished: the job of efficient supply. But not demand. Universal employment is no longer needed; but with decreased employment- wages go down; therefore there are too few customers to buy products & services. Basic Income is gaining bipartisan support. Replace means-tested benefits with a monthly payment- distributed in the same amount to every citizen- pegged to productivity to stay ahead of inflation. Stop paying a bureaucracy to determine who needs or deserves social assistance. Income inequality is not just an ethical issue. The existence of a large middle class is the only way to keep the economy going.",FALSE,PUBLIC,"none"
