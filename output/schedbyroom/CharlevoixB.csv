On one side- there are those who are blindly optimistic about technology. This attitude is sometimes termed 'technosolutionism-' the na-ve idea that every problem can be solved with technology. At the other extreme are those so critical of technology that they adopt an unrealistic Luddite attitude- avoiding technology altogether- or they assume that a dystopian future is inevitable and- as a result- become passive. Critical optimism navigates between these two extremes- encouraging an earnest hopefulness that also incorporates a healthy dose of criticality.
