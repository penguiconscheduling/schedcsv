4/25/2015,9:00,4/25/2015,9:50,50 minutes,"Windover",Science, Tech,"The Ethics of AI","Samuel Hansen, Jennifer Marsman",'If we develop an artificial intelligence that talks like a human- thinks like a human- and acts like a human- it will be fair to expect it to abide by the same social contract as a human. The problem is that if Artificial Intelligence comes to pass it is very unlikely that it will be anything like a human. This brings us to the very hazy area of the ethics surrounding AI. What rules do we have a right to enforce on a living entity that is nothing like us? How dangerous is it to develop something that we will not be able to fully understand and will be able to think a lot faster than us? What if AI is actually kind of dumb?',FALSE,PUBLIC,none

Hundreds- if not thousands of blogs exist that proclaim IPv6 is ready for the world- and yet- 99%+ of all Internet traffic is still the legacy IPv4 protocol. Why? Existing IPv6 advocacy has focused on technical users leading the charge- and adoption of deployment methodologies that were obsolete before IPv4 address exhaustion was even considered a major issue.
