Christopher Bright shows us how to use the Arduino microcontroller to take in information and then express it through lights, sounds, or motion. The potential here is limitless. Arduinos have been used to build opensource EEG machines, heart rate monitors, robotic motion controllers. In this workshop you will create a heart-rate sensor that in turn flashes an LED on time. The hook is that the LED is a UV light (blacklight) led and it is encased by a chip of uranium glass which glows sickly nuke yellow under blacklight. Easy, and very fun.  I will have plenty of micro boards on hand for folks to play with and a selection of kits for sale at dramatically reduced prices compared to retail."

Why? Should these machines be relegated as mere curiosities of a forgotten age? Has Craig gone completely mental?

csvsafedescrip,Lessons from Artificial Intelligence- Software Engineering- and Computer Science. Science is a continual and methodical process to match models to data (phenomenon) for utilitarian purposes. Science has the following Elements: Data; Models (e.g. Theories); Properties of Models- including computational characteristics and data matching measures; and Properties of Data- including measures of data to real world mapping. Science has no opinions- has no votes- no laws- no authorities- only naked properties- and measures. Lessons include: Reality- Models- Spaghetti- Measurement- Development- and Issues. Examples include: Entropy- Transformation of Energy- Relativity- and Sub-Quantum Kinetics.

The existence of a large middle class is the only way to keep the economy going."
Presenters,"Matt Arnold, Edward L. Platt, Kevin O'Brian, Zach Blagg, Dana Nelson (Moderator) "
csvsafedescrip,Capitalism worked. The reason it's stalling is that its job is successfully finished: the job of efficient supply. But not demand. Universal employment is no longer needed; but with decreased employment- wages go down; therefore there are too few customers to buy products & services. Basic Income is gaining bipartisan support. Replace means-tested benefits with a monthly payment- distributed in the same amount to every citizen- pegged to productivity to stay ahead of inflation. Stop paying a bureaucracy to determine who needs or deserves social assistance. Income inequality is not just an ethical issue. The existence of a large middle class is the only way to keep the economy going.
