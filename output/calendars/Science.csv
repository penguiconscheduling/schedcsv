"The Ethics of AI",4/25/2015,9:00,4/25/2015,9:50,FALSE,"If we develop an artificial intelligence that talks like a human, thinks like a human, and acts like a human, it will be fair to expect it to abide by the same social contract as a human. The problem is that if Artificial Intelligence comes to pass it is very unlikely that it will be anything like a human. This brings us to the very hazy area of the ethics surrounding AI. What rules do we have a right to enforce on a living entity that is nothing like us? How dangerous is it to develop something that we will not be able to fully understand and will be able to think a lot faster than us? What if AI is actually kind of dumb?  Speakers include:Samuel Hansen, Jennifer Marsman, Karl Schroeder","Windover",PUBLIC
