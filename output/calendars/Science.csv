"DIY Mad Science",4/25/2015,19:00,4/25/2015,19:50,FALSE,"If you’ve ever seen the Southpark Episode where Butters, er, we mean Professor Chaos, tries to destroy the world by leaving the water faucet on overnight, you know that to be a true mad scientist, you need much cooler tools and designs.  We think the world is pretty nifty as it is, but wouldn’t it be a better world with propeller driven cars, corn starch flamethrowers, and steampunk organ backpacks?  Come learn how to turn ordinary objects into awesome objects from our mad scientist Guests of Honor!  Speakers include:Jen Owen, Ivan Owen","Charlevoix C",PUBLIC

"SciComm: Communicating Science to the Public",4/25/2015,18:00,4/25/2015,18:50,FALSE,"People are not naturally uninterested in what is happening in science and mathematics. Science Communication does what it can to tell everyone the stories of science in an engaging and interesting way, but it is not an easy task. An approach that works for astronomy could well fail when talking about new mathematics research. This panel will gather together people who communicate science for a discussion about the tools and techniques they use to tell mathematical and scientific stories, and about their successes and their failures.  Speakers include:Samuel Hansen, Constance L. Martin-Trembley, Bob Trembley, Annalee Newitz","Algonquin C",PUBLIC
"Biohacking: Upgrading the Human Body",4/25/2015,18:00,4/25/2015,19:50,FALSE,"A mix of technology, DIY, and mayhem - biohacking is a particularly interesting offshoot of the maker renaissance. We will be discussing the physical and psychological process of upgrading the human body, the potential for humanity, the impact of h+ on society, and more! Please join us for a panel discussion, and maybe volunteer to get yourself upgraded live on stage with an xNT NFC implant from Dangerous Things!  Speakers include:Amal Graafstra, Drew Buglione, Anita Fowler, Tim Cannon, Cynthia Chestek","Charlevoix A",PUBLIC

"Asteroids, Near-Earth Objects, and Meteorites",4/25/2015,20:00,4/25/2015,20:50,FALSE,"The discovery rate of asteroids and near-earth object has exploded in the last decade due to advances in imaging technologies. Bob discusses Solar System formation - where asteroids, comets, and meteorites came from, and their history. Also discussed are the Chelyabinsk, Tunguska, and K-T impact events. Bob will bring pieces of his meteorite collection for audience members to see and handle!  Speakers include:Bob Trembley","Algonquin D",PUBLIC
"DIY Bionics with 3D Printers ",4/25/2015,20:00,4/25/2015,20:50,FALSE,"A Prosthetic resource reports that a lower extremity prosthesis (leg) can range in cost from $5,000 to $50,000. An upper extremity device (arm) can range from $3,000 to $30,000.  Why pay an arm and a leg for an arm and a leg?  Learn how you can use your 3D printer to produce prosthetics from open source designs for $30 in materials.  Take it a step further and add biological sensing electronics for less than $250.   Speakers include:Albert Manero, Jen Owen, Ivan Owen","Charlevoix B",PUBLIC

"Aerospace Engineering for Beginners",4/26/2015,12:00,4/26/2015,12:50,FALSE,"The Bureau of transportation estimates that one out of every three american adults has flown in an airplane in the last year.  Think about what a miracle that is. As Neal Stephenson so eloquently put it, all those people, “strapped into bad chairs, stuffed into an aluminum tube aslosh with jet fuel,” hurtling through the atmosphere at up to 85% of the speed of sound.  What goes into that modern day miracle?  What kind of things do you learn as an Aerospace Engineering Doctorate Candidate?  Come listen to Albert Manero, who just happens to be one!

Come join some authors and technologists as they talk about science fiction themes that are now a reality and what's coming next!  Speakers include:Annalee Newitz, Ed Mason, Karl Schroeder, Charlie Jane Anders, Jen Haeger","Windover",PUBLIC
"Misconceptions of Scienctific Work",4/26/2015,15:00,4/26/2015,15:50,FALSE,"Mathematicians are crazy loners that slave in front of chalkboards every second of every day in a singular pursuit of the next great theorem. Chemists pace their labs full of brightly colored chemicals and glass tubing that could have only been designed by Rube Goldberg trying to get their reactions correct. This panel will visit some of the most incorrect misconceptions in modern culture, and the most interesting, and try to set the record straight as to what our scientists are actually doing all day.  Speakers include:Samuel Hansen, Mari Brighe","Charlevoix B",PUBLIC
