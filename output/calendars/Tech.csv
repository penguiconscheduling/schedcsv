"Agile Escape Room",5/5/2019,13:00,5/5/2019,14:00,FALSE,"Its the agile zombie Apocalypse. You and your friends are trapped and all that stands between you and lunch is a locked door and three puzzle boxes. Each puzzle, once solved becomes an important component of the key. Every team must solve all three of their puzzles in order to complete the key. There is one key to rule them all. Only then may you leave the room before its you who becomes lunch. Are you willing to stake the lives of your team on your agile knowledge? Oh and by the way, how closely did you follow Scrum and agile principles in obtaining your release?

"Understanding USB: Why This Cable Works, and That One Doesn't",5/5/2019,13:00,5/5/2019,14:00,FALSE,"In a sane world, if a cable fits, plugging it in would always do what you expect. Generally thats true, whether you're plugging in a toaster, or connecting something to your TVs HDMI port. USB, on the other hand, is a complete dumpster fire. Different generations, protocols, alternate modes, and proprietary charging specs mean that it can take an appallingly long time to copy a file or charge your phone. You'll walk away from this talk, knowing how the messy USB standard works, and the secret to why some of your cables, chargers, and devices just don't seem to like each other.
