What are the relevant laws- and what should you expect?  Why would someone want to carry a weapon in the first place?  What does this really mean with respect to your rights- safety- encounters with those carrying in public- and any response from law enforcement? Join our panelists in a discussion on these and related topics.  Sharing of personal experiences is strongly encouraged. Please note that this is a logic-based discussion primarily regarding the law and it's implications- and there may be conflicting viewpoints.  Some people have extremely strong views on the subject of gun control.  We expect participants to respect the views of others.  Anyone unable to do so will be asked to leave.',FALSE,PUBLIC,none
