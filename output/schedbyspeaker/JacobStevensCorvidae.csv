Jacob Corvidae did too- and then set about trying to live a real-life adventure. It didn't have as many fairies or spaceships as he might have liked- but it's turned out pretty well. Tackling environmental work (or any other activism) can be daunting and discouraging- but it can also be a great source of joy and purpose. And for Jacob it's led to some unusual places and adventures. He'll share his story and then we'll have a discussion about how to become the hero of your own adventure. ',FALSE,PUBLIC,none
