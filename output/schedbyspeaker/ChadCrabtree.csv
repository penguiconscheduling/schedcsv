Free Pascal is a modern compiler for Pascal that works on nearly all platforms.  It is a low-level- object-oriented programming language that is pretty darned fast.  There will also be a demo of Lazarus- an IDE and cross platform GUI toolkit that allows one to make native applications on Windows/Linux/OSX with one code base.  Expose yourself to the granddaddy programming language that has continued to learn new tricks.  ',FALSE,PUBLIC,Projector
