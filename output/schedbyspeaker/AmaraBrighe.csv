"How to Respect your Transgender Peers",5/2/2014,19:00,5/2/2014,19:50,FALSE,"More people are transitioning publicly in geek social circles where they feel less threatened and more accepted, so it's getting more likely that you will know or meet one. Come hear a transgender person talk about the best way to approach, discuss, and respect transgender people. This presentation focuses on the social aspects of dealing with transgender people with a brief discussion of the physical aspects of transition. Most trans people do not have an easy time, but friends and peers can help by not accidentally saying something rude that makes the trans person feel uncomfortable. Bad attitudes and bad language will not be tolerated.
