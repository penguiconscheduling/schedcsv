Come hear a transgender person talk about the best way to approach- discuss- and respect transgender people. This presentation focuses on the social aspects of dealing with transgender people with a brief discussion of the physical aspects of transition. Most trans people do not have an easy time- but friends and peers can help by not accidentally saying something rude that makes the trans person feel uncomfortable. Bad attitudes and bad language will not be tolerated. ',FALSE,PUBLIC,none
