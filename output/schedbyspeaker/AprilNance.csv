With the way we are already judging each other for who is the most ‘L337’ nerd- it’s no surprise that women are getting even more judgement from the nerd community at large. Where are all the female heroes? The tournament-winning chicks? And why are you judging me for kicking YOUR butt in Super Smash Bros.? No matter your gender- please join in on this hot topic! This panel aims to discuss the social issues- inequality and perks that come with being a geeky lady!',FALSE,PUBLIC,Projector
