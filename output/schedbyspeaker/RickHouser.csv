"Key Signing Party",4/26/2015,10:00,4/26/2015,12:50,FALSE,"In this hands-on event, participants will learn how the web of trust model works and perform identify verification with fellow attendees.  We will do so in a manner compatible with CAcert.org, so you can use the resulting identify assurance to issue your own free SSL certificates, code signatures, etc.  With a little additional work, you can also become an assurer of your own right at Penguicon.  We will also exchange OpenPGP keys if you have them, so bring your key fingerprints with you! Participants need to bring at least two forms of ID -- at least one of which must be a government issued ID showing birthdate. Having your own notebook computer able to output PDFs files greatly simplifies things, too. New users are expected to show up at the start, but returning participants from Penguicon Keysigning events and any CAcert.org assurers may show up one hour in.  Speakers include:Rick Houser - Track: Tech  - Duration: 2 hours and 50 minutes - Audio/video needs: none ","Charlevoix A",PUBLIC
