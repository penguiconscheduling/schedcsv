"Basic Skills for Working with Electronics",4/29/2016,17:00,4/29/2016,17:50,FALSE,"This presentation will cover the very very basics of DC circuit theory and the skills needed to cut and prep wire and then solder it together or to a component.  Speakers include:Christopher Bright - Track: DIY, Tech  - Duration: 50 minutes - Audio/video needs: none ","EMC I",PUBLIC
"Microprocessor Magic",4/29/2016,19:00,4/29/2016,19:50,FALSE,"Add movement, color, sound, and interactivity with a tiny computer system designed for artists and designers. Christopher Bright shows us how to use the Arduino microcontroller to take in information and then express it through lights, sounds, or motion. The potential here is limitless. Arduinos have been used to build opensource EEG machines, heart rate monitors, robotic motion controllers. In this workshop you will create a heart-rate sensor that in turn flashes an LED on time. Easy, and very fun. I will have plenty of micro boards on hand for folks to play with and a selection of kits for sale at dramatically reduced prices compared to retail.  Speakers include:Christopher Bright - Track: DIY, Tech  - Duration: 50 minutes - Audio/video needs: none ","Baldwin",PUBLIC
"Wearable Computing: Technology You Can Stitch Right In",5/1/2016,11:00,5/1/2016,11:50,FALSE,"Here we build off the Microprocessor Magic workshop and introduce a specialized version of the Arduino board. The Lilypad is a purpose-built design for the Arduino that is intended to be sewn into a garment or costume. Imagine a keypad sewn right into the sleeve of your jacket. What for? Actuate a glowing turn signal on the back of your riding jacket? Fire up the IR illuminators for your wearable cameras? Or you have a costume and you want the lights and tones to blink and bloop in time with your steps. The modules and connectors are sewn in and in most casdes can be handwashed along with the garment.
