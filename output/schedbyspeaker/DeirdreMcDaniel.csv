Come hear a transgender person talk about the best way to approach- discuss- and respect transgender people. This presentation focuses on the social aspects of dealing with transgender people with a brief discussion of the physical aspects of transition.

Bad attitudes and bad language will not be tolerated. ',FALSE,PUBLIC,none
