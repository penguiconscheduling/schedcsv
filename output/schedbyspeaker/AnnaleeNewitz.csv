Science Communication does what it can to tell everyone the stories of science in an engaging and interesting way, but it is not an easy task. An approach that works for astronomy could well fail when talking about new mathematics research. This panel will gather together people who communicate science for a discussion about the tools and techniques they use to tell mathematical and scientific stories, and about their successes and their failures.  Speakers include:Samuel Hansen, Constance L. Martin-Trembley, Bob Trembley, Annalee Newitz - Track: Science  - Duration: 50 minutes - Audio/video needs: none ","Algonquin C",PUBLIC
