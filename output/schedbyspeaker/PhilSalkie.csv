"Designing Industrial Control Systems to Resist Cyberattack",4/25/2015,10:00,4/25/2015,10:50,FALSE,"Industrial Control Systems are late arrivals to the 'Internet Age,' and many of the connectivity options which are available for Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) were not designed with network security in mind.  Vendors can take years to fix known vulnerabilities, or in some cases just seem to ignore them outright.  The internet has brought once remote, disconnected devices within reach of 'bad actors' everywhere - network-based attacks on controls systems are on the increase. Fortunately, spending time in the design phase can overcome a majority of these problems at minimal expense, protecting your system through its architecture.  This class will discuss the design of PLC systems and the network communications options which are available today, and how to select components to minimize external attack surface.

The classes are held monthly at a DHS facility in Idaho Falls and consist of classroom time and a ten-hour red-team/blue-team attack/defense scenario.  The presenters attended the course in February 2015 - now they would like to share their notes and impressions with Penguicon.  If you are involved with industrial automation in any way, this session will let you know what the training class provides, and help you decide whether a trip to Idaho Falls should be in your future. For what it's worth, both presenters were on the winning team - Go, Defense!
