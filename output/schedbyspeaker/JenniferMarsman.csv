"Fun with Mind Reading: Using EEG and Azure Machine Learning to Perform Lie Detection",4/30/2016,15:00,4/30/2016,15:50,FALSE,"Using EEG and Azure Machine Learning to perform lie detection. Today, we have the technology to “read minds” (well, EEG waves!).  Using an EPOC headset from Emotiv, I have captured 14 channels of EEG (brain waves) while subjects lied and answered truthfully to a series of questions.  I fed this labelled dataset into Azure Machine Learning to build a classifier which predicts whether a subject is telling the truth or lying.  In this session, I will share my results on this “lie detector” experiment.  I will show my machine learning models, data cleaning process, results, and next steps/resources.  This session will be a fun look inside your brain waves along with demonstrations of data processing and predictive analytics.  Speakers include:Jennifer Marsman - Track: Tech  - Duration: 50 minutes - Audio/video needs: none ","Windover",PUBLIC
"Intro to Azure Machine Learning: Predict Who Survives the Titanic",5/1/2016,13:00,5/1/2016,13:50,FALSE,"Interested in doing machine learning in the cloud? In this talk, I will discuss different types of machine learning (clustering, classification, regression, and anomaly detection) supported by Azure Machine Learning. I’ll demonstrate using Azure Machine Learning to build a model which predicts survival of individuals on the Titanic (one of the challenges on the Kaggle website). You’ll leave knowing how to get started and build your own predictive models using Azure Machine Learning.

"The Reality and Fiction of Artificial Intelligence",4/30/2016,12:00,4/30/2016,12:50,FALSE,"Artificial intelligences have been a staple of science fiction forever.  But where does the reality of AI end, and the fiction begin?    Speakers include:Ann Leckie, Jason Mars, Lingjia Tang, Jennifer Marsman - Track: Tech  - Duration: 50 minutes - Audio/video needs: none ","Algonquin D",PUBLIC
