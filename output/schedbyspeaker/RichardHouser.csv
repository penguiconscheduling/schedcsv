"Keysigning Party",4/30/2016,11:00,4/30/2016,13:50,FALSE,"In this hands-on event, participants will learn how the web of trust model works and perform identity verification with fellow attendees. We will do so in a manner compatible with CAcert.org, so you can use the resulting identify assurance to issue your own free SSL certificates, code signatures, etc. With a little additional work, you can also become an assurer of your own right at Penguicon. We will also exchange OpenPGP keys if you have them, so bring your key fingerprints with you! Participants need to bring at least two forms of ID — at least one of which must be a government issued photo ID showing birthdate. Having your own notebook computer able to output PDFs files greatly simplifies things, too. New users are expected to show up at the start, but returning participants from Penguicon Keysigning events and any CAcert.org assurers may show up one hour in.  Speakers include:Richard Houser - Track: Tech  - Duration: 2 hours and 50 minutes - Audio/video needs: none ","EMC IV",PUBLIC
"Open Source Maker Apps",5/1/2016,11:00,5/1/2016,11:50,FALSE,"The maker movement has been making headlines, in particular the 3D printer space.  Something that is often overlooked is the state of the software.  Many manufacturers ship closed source software, which is against the spirit of the movement.  We'll go through a quick overview of one 3D printer toolchain (FreeCAD, Slic3r, OctoPrint), and discuss possible alternatives at each stage.  Other participants are strongly encouraged to bring a laptop running their maker software of choice (OSS only, please!) to share in a 2-5minute show and tell fashion.  Other maker toolchain applications would be particularly welcome (PCB design/circuit simulation, CNC tooling, laser cutters, etc).  Speakers include:Richard Houser - Track: Tech  - Duration: 50 minutes - Audio/video needs: none ","EMC IV",PUBLIC
"Learn To Play Dominion",5/1/2016,14:00,5/1/2016,14:50,FALSE,"The original game that created the deck-building genre. Players start with the same simple deck, and use their cards to buy cards into their collection from the middle of the table. They go through their deck repeatedly to use their new cards to buy even more lucrative cards. Each time you play, a different set of ten cards is available. Can you pick the best blend of cards?
