"The Dawn Mission at Dwarf Planet Ceres",4/24/2015,19:00,4/24/2015,19:50,FALSE,"The Dawn spacecraft will approach the Dwarf Planet Ceres in February of 2015, and go into orbit of Ceres in the Spring of 2015. In this lecture, Bob discusses the Dawn spacecraft and its ion propulsion system, its 2011 visit to the asteroid Vesta, and new photos and scientific findings about Ceres. It, and several other 'planets' got demoted to asteroid status in the 1850's. Ceres' status was updated to 'Dwarf Planet' in 2006, along with Pluto.

"SciComm: Communicating Science to the Public",4/25/2015,18:00,4/25/2015,18:50,FALSE,"People are not naturally uninterested in what is happening in science and mathematics. Science Communication does what it can to tell everyone the stories of science in an engaging and interesting way, but it is not an easy task. An approach that works for astronomy could well fail when talking about new mathematics research. This panel will gather together people who communicate science for a discussion about the tools and techniques they use to tell mathematical and scientific stories, and about their successes and their failures.  Speakers include:Samuel Hansen, Constance L. Martin-Trembley, Bob Trembley, Annalee Newitz - Track: Science  - Duration: 50 minutes - Audio/video needs: none ","Algonquin C",PUBLIC
"Asteroids, Near-Earth Objects, and Meteorites",4/25/2015,20:00,4/25/2015,20:50,FALSE,"The discovery rate of asteroids and near-earth object has exploded in the last decade due to advances in imaging technologies. Bob discusses Solar System formation - where asteroids, comets, and meteorites came from, and their history. Also discussed are the Chelyabinsk, Tunguska, and K-T impact events. Bob will bring pieces of his meteorite collection for audience members to see and handle!
