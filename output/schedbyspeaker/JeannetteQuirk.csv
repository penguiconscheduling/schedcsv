"The Smithee Awards",4/25/2015,20:00,4/25/2015,23:50,FALSE,"The Smithee Awards watches Bad Movies all year long, then clips the best bad bits from the films and pits them together cage match style to go head to head (to head to head to head) with each other. 19 typical B-Cinema categories (Worst Science!, Stupidest Looking Monster!, Acting Appropriately Stupid! And many more!), 5 clips per category. Come for the whole show (Most Ludicrous Premise through Worst Picture) or come for a couple categories. Either way, if you even like bad films a little, we think you'll enjoy The Smithee Awards more. The Smithee Awards are not particularly child safe as some of the clips contain nudity, violence or strong language, often all in the same clip.  Speakers include:Jeannette Quirk, Matthew Quirk, Amy Conlon, Kevin Hogan - Track: Film, After Dark  - Duration: 3 hours and 50 minutes - Audio/video needs: Microphone, Projector, Sound System ","Portage Auditorium",PUBLIC
