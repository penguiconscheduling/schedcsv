"My Kiln Control Project (Powered by Raspberry Pi)","5/4/2019","19:00","5/4/2019","20:00","FALSE","I created a kiln control program with my Raspberry Pi 3 for a DIY superconductor project. To make this superconductor, the chemicals must be heated for days and then carefully cooled down in a controlled manner. To minimize costs, I bought an inexpensive glass annealing kiln and wrote a Python GUI program to use a Raspberry Pi 3 as the kiln temperature controller. This talk will discuss the tools I used for this project including Raspberry Pi 3, Raspian, Gtk3, Git, Python3, Visual Studio Code, Glade, and Matplotlib.
