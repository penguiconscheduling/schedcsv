"Rethinking Urban Spaces",4/25/2015,15:00,4/25/2015,17:50,FALSE,"We'll talk about the types of lands used (single vacant parcel, blighted multifamily flat, commercial space) and what is legal. We'll use three examples: An Urban Farm, A Shipping Container homestead retrofitted on a preexisting blighted bungalow, and a Retention pond created from the basement of a blighted home. Participants will break into groups to come up with novel ideas for repurposing urban infrastructure together. Maybe we can come up with some truly innovative project ideas for real world use!

This presentation will focus on outlining best-practices for using free technology to build a sustainable organization from the ground up. Case studies will include the Michigan Urban Farming Initiative and will cover social media, crowd-funding, task-management software, web development, geomapping, 3D & graphic design, and industry secrets.
