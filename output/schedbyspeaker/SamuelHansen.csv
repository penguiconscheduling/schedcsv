"SciComm: Communicating Science to the Public",4/25/2015,18:00,4/25/2015,18:50,FALSE,"People are not naturally uninterested in what is happening in science and mathematics. Science Communication does what it can to tell everyone the stories of science in an engaging and interesting way, but it is not an easy task. An approach that works for astronomy could well fail when talking about new mathematics research. This panel will gather together people who communicate science for a discussion about the tools and techniques they use to tell mathematical and scientific stories, and about their successes and their failures.  Speakers include:Samuel Hansen, Constance L. Martin-Trembley, Bob Trembley, Annalee Newitz - Track: Science  - Duration: 50 minutes - Audio/video needs: none ","Algonquin C",PUBLIC
"The Ethics of AI",4/25/2015,9:00,4/25/2015,9:50,FALSE,"If we develop an artificial intelligence that talks like a human, thinks like a human, and acts like a human, it will be fair to expect it to abide by the same social contract as a human. The problem is that if Artificial Intelligence comes to pass it is very unlikely that it will be anything like a human. This brings us to the very hazy area of the ethics surrounding AI. What rules do we have a right to enforce on a living entity that is nothing like us? How dangerous is it to develop something that we will not be able to fully understand and will be able to think a lot faster than us? What if AI is actually kind of dumb?
