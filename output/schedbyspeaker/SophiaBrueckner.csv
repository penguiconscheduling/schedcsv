"Critical Optimism",05/04/2019,16:00,05/04/2019,17:00,TRUE,"Peoples ability to envision the future tends to fall between two unhealthy and unconstructive extremes. On one side, there are those who are blindly optimistic about technology. This attitude is sometimes termed 'technosolutionism,' the na-ve idea that every problem can be solved with technology. At the other extreme are those so critical of technology that they adopt an unrealistic Luddite attitude, avoiding technology altogether, or they assume that a dystopian future is inevitable and, as a result, become passive. Critical optimism navigates between these two extremes, encouraging an earnest hopefulness that also incorporates a healthy dose of criticality. What futures are possible, which are probable, and, most importantly, which might be preferred?  Speakers include:Sophia Brueckner - Track: Tech  - Duration: 1 hour ","Charlevoix B",PUBLIC

The very common and most interesting result of this workshop is that people realize how strongly they lean towards either dystopian or utopian thinking about the future of technology, which results in an excellent discussion at the end of the workshop.The goal of the workshop is to encourage people to avoid unproductive extremes of utopian/dystopian thinking and adopt a more critically optimistic, balanced approach to thinking about technology and the future.
