"Building an Open Source Artificial Pancreas",5/3/2019,16:00,5/3/2019,17:00,FALSE,"What if open source software or hardware could help improve peoples lives by solving some of their health problems? After the medical tech industry kept promising a system to help automatically manage insulin for type 1 diabetic people and never delivering, some people got together to find ways to do it with the tech they already had. Over the past few years, a 'closed-loop' system has been developed to algorithmically regulate peoples blood sugars. As a diabetic, the presenter built this system and saw her sugar values stabilize much more than would be possibly by managing them manually. Learn about OpenAPS (the open artificial pancreas system) and how it works, what problems it solves, and its safety and security concerns. The presenter will also share her personal experience and what OpenAPS means for her health now and in the future. Consider how we, as software developers, can change peoples lives through the code we write.  Speakers include:Sarah Withee - Track: Tech  - Duration: 1 hour ","Algonquin C/D",PUBLIC
"Maintaining Your Mental and Emotional Health While Job Hunting",5/3/2019,18:00,5/3/2019,19:00,FALSE,"Searching for a new job? We all have to do it at some point. In the thick of the search, you're likely to get a lot of terrible tech interviews as well as a bunch of rejections. How do you maintain your energy, motivation, and perhaps more importantly, not feel like a failure after all that? I will talk a bit about my most recent job search. Youll see how I went into it with a different frame of mind than I had in the past, and how that helped me push through the interviews easier and take better care of myself in the process. You'll also hear about some of the specific interviews and the problems I saw with them. I'll show how, as companies and teams, we can improve the process for everyone. Finally, I'll offer ways that both companies and employees can offer feedback to continue to improve interviews.  Speakers include:Sarah Withee - Track: Life  - Duration: 1 hour ","EMC IV",PUBLIC
