5/2/2014,18:00,5/2/2014,18:50,50 minutes,"Board of Governors",Lit,"The Hidden Sub-Genres","Jim Leach, Sean M. Davis",'The number of genres into which Speculative Fiction may be divided approaches infinity.  Most are familiar with Hard Sci-Fi- the Space Opera- and Urban Fantasy.  There are also lesser known sub-genres like Bizarro Fiction that fall in the SFF spectrum.  How would you define Bizarro Fiction?  What are the must reads in this field?',FALSE,PUBLIC,none
5/3/2014,11:00,5/3/2014,11:50,50 minutes,"Baldwin Board Room",Lit,"Digging Up The Same Old Ground","Sean M. Davis, Ferrett Steinmetz, NIcole Castle",'Are there any new stories left- or is everything just a retread of an old idea?  What is a retread- and what is a legitimately new angle?',FALSE,PUBLIC,none

Davis, Michael Cieslak, Nicole Castle, Jim Leach, John Scalzi",'In a world where some of the most watched shows deal with SFF themes or have been adapted from SFF material (Game of Thrones- The Walking Dead- The Lord of the Rings/The Hobbit- The Avengers et. al.) where does the “mainstream” line get drawn?  Why is it suddenly acceptable for the SFF genre to be viewed?  Has this translated over to the written word?  Side question: why has mystery always been more or less accepted but SFF is a more recent explosion?',FALSE,PUBLIC,none
5/3/2014,17:00,5/3/2014,17:50,50 minutes,"Baldwin Board Room",Lit,"Line?  What Line?  Taboos and Speculative Fiction","Ken MacGreggor, Sean M. Davis, Ferrett Steinmetz, Nicole Castle",'Incest- rape- children as warriors- the wholesale slaughter of children... there are many distasteful acts which are performed in speculative fiction.  Is there anything which is still off limits- or can anything be used as a plot device so long as it is germane to the story?',FALSE,PUBLIC,none
5/3/2014,18:00,5/3/2014,18:50,50 minutes,"Board of Governors",Lit,"Obligatory Undead Panel: Is Undead Dead","Mary Lynne Gibbs, Michael Cieslak, Sean M. Davis, Ken MacGreggor",'Shoot ‘em in the head- stake ‘em through the heart- the good old silver bullet...it doesn’t matter- the undead keep coming back.  Have zombies- vampires- and werewolves finally run their course or do these creatures still have legs?  Is there a division between genre fans who have grown tired of these creatures just as they’re taking off in the general public?',FALSE,PUBLIC,none
