"Basic Design Criteria for 3D-Printed Firearms",5/1/2016,13:00,5/1/2016,13:50,FALSE,"This talk will teach the basics of engineering structural parts to be fabricated using extruded plastic from a 3D printer nozzle.  Simple design concepts such as tensile strength, Poisson's ratio, and stress risers will be explained and used to demonstrate how to make optimal material, shape, and functional choices.  Particular attention will be paid to the peculiarities of parts made with layers of extruded plastic and destined for the high-stresses imparted on parts destined for use in 3D-printed firearms.
