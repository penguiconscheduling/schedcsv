"Swinger *or* Poly?  Swinger *and* Poly?",5/3/2014,22:00,5/3/2014,22:50,FALSE,"Many times, the terms 'swinger' and 'polyamorous' get conflated.  Many times, they overlap.  In the world of alternate relationship styles, one can meet swingers who look suspiciously upon polyfolk.  Similarly, one can also meet polyfolk who sneer a bit at swingers.  But why?  Can't we all just get it on? (I mean, get along?) This session is in audience-participation format (not like that, keep your kilts ON!) and seeks to get some of the common stereotypes out in the open, toward the goal of greater understanding on both sides of the 'aisle.'  The Venn Diagram might well inspire you.  It'll be run by folks who have their feet in both worlds, and it'll include an ask-us-anything time.  Speakers include:Phil Chase, Dana Chase, Amy Joynt - Track: After Dark  - Duration: 50 minutes - Audio/video needs: none ","Nicolet",PUBLIC
