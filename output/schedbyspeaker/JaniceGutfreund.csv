"STIs: Facts, Fictions, and Fables",5/3/2019,21:00,5/3/2019,22:00,FALSE,"This presentation will take a look at the social history of STI prevention from the 20th century to the present. It will address how facts and social conditions shaped prevention strategies both then and now. When we look at what is actually true about STIs in terms of actual risk, treatments available, and prevention, we see how sex-negative beliefs still influence our perceptions. We will discuss ways of combating stigma within ourselves and how to talk to our partners and potential partners about risk. <br />  Speakers include:Janice Gutfreund - Track: Life  - Duration: 1 hour ","Charlevoix B",PUBLIC
