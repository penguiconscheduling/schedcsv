You can be one of those computers! Navigate your robot across conveyor belts- over gears- and past pushers in your effort to be the first to touch all the checkpoints. But watch out for the other robots- not only are they trying to beat you to the checkpoints- but they might even try to push you off course. And don't forget the lasers mounted throughout the factory- and on each of the other robots too. Easy to learn- hard to master. This factory is definitely not approved by the UAW.',FALSE,PUBLIC,none
