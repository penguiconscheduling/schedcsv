5/2/2014,18:00,5/2/2014,18:50,50 minutes,"Board of Governors",Lit,"The Hidden Sub-Genres","Jim Leach, Sean M. Davis",'The number of genres into which Speculative Fiction may be divided approaches infinity.  Most are familiar with Hard Sci-Fi- the Space Opera- and Urban Fantasy.  There are also lesser known sub-genres like Bizarro Fiction that fall in the SFF spectrum.  How would you define Bizarro Fiction?  What are the must reads in this field?',FALSE,PUBLIC,none
5/2/2014,19:00,5/2/2014,19:50,50 minutes,"Baldwin Board Room",Lit,"Plotters vs Pantsers – Finding the Storytelling That Works For You","Ferrett Steinmetz, Michael Cieslak, Jim Leach",'Some writers are plotters- and can’t proceed until they know how everything ends.  Some writers are pantsers- and they surprise themselves as they go.  How can you figure out which one you are- and how can you harness the strengths of each approach while avoiding the weaknesses? ',FALSE,PUBLIC,none
5/3/2014,14:00,5/3/2014,14:50,50 minutes,"Windover",Lit,"When Did We Get Cool? The SFF Explosion on Screen","Ernie Cline, Sean M. Davis, Michael Cieslak, Nicole Castle, Jim Leach, John Scalzi",'In a world where some of the most watched shows deal with SFF themes or have been adapted from SFF material (Game of Thrones- The Walking Dead- The Lord of the Rings/The Hobbit- The Avengers et. al.) where does the “mainstream” line get drawn?  Why is it suddenly acceptable for the SFF genre to be viewed?  Has this translated over to the written word?  Side question: why has mystery always been more or less accepted but SFF is a more recent explosion?',FALSE,PUBLIC,none
5/3/2014,16:00,5/3/2014,16:50,50 minutes,"Baldwin Board Room",Lit,"What About The Happily Ever After?"," Jim Leach, Ferrett Steinmetz",'There was an insane Internet reaction to the Red Wedding from those who were watching Game of Thrones but hadn’t read it (to the reader's delight).  Is this indicative of an expectation among television and movie audiences that established characters survive?  Has Hollywood created the expectation of a happy ending- even in the harshest of fictional environments?  Is it more acceptable to kill off a character in print?  How do these expectations differ amongst genre fiction?',FALSE,PUBLIC,none
5/4/2014,14:00,5/4/2014,14:50,50 minutes,"Board of Governors",Lit,"Indeterminacy as a Compositional Tool: Tarot Cards and Writing","Jim Leach",'Artists- at least since the surrealists- have employed various techniques to introduce a bit of 'chance' into the production of art pieces. One such technique is tarot cards. Aside from any possible use as a divination process- tarot cards are narratively-primed- image-rich- easily-shuffled tidbits ready to add creativity to processes such as writing. Presenter James Frederick Leach has played with 'The Cards' as a tool for plotting- character development and whittling away at writer's block. This presentation will feature workshop components so bring your portable composition tool of choice.',FALSE,PUBLIC,none
