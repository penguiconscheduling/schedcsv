One such technique is tarot cards. Aside from any possible use as a divination process- tarot cards are narratively-primed- image-rich- easily-shuffled tidbits ready to add creativity to processes such as writing. Presenter James Frederick Leach has played with 'The Cards' as a tool for plotting- character development and whittling away at writer's block. This presentation will feature workshop components so bring your portable composition tool of choice.',FALSE,PUBLIC,none
