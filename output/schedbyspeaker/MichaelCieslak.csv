5/2/2014,16:00,5/2/2014,16:50,50 minutes,"Montcalm",Lit,"Sequels and Series in Genre Fiction","Mary Lynne Gibbs, Michael Cieslak",'We all love that feeling we get when we can fully immerse ourselves in a fictional world.  Conversely- the return to the real world can be quite shocking.  Is this part of the reason for the prevalence of series work in genre fiction?  Is it something from the publishing side?  Is there a place for the stand alone work in SFF?',FALSE,PUBLIC,none

Davis, Michael Cieslak, Nicole Castle, Jim Leach, John Scalzi",'In a world where some of the most watched shows deal with SFF themes or have been adapted from SFF material (Game of Thrones- The Walking Dead- The Lord of the Rings/The Hobbit- The Avengers et. al.) where does the “mainstream” line get drawn?  Why is it suddenly acceptable for the SFF genre to be viewed?  Has this translated over to the written word?

Davis, Ken MacGreggor",'Shoot ‘em in the head- stake ‘em through the heart- the good old silver bullet...it doesn’t matter- the undead keep coming back.  Have zombies- vampires- and werewolves finally run their course or do these creatures still have legs?  Is there a division between genre fans who have grown tired of these creatures just as they’re taking off in the general public?',FALSE,PUBLIC,none

Mary Lynne Gibbs, Michael Cieslak",'Editing is an important part of creating a book- even if it isn't as sexy as- you know- actually writing.  We'll be discussing editing- query letters- and all of the business crap that comes along with doing this for a living.',FALSE,PUBLIC,none
