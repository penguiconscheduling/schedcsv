We will explore how changing our perspective on mental health issues- from one focused on disability to one highlighting ability- can not only benefit the future of the individual but also the future of our society. Panelists who live with a variety of different mental health issues will talk about their experiences living and working in a society that focuses on 'can't.'',FALSE,PUBLIC,Projector
