"From Batgirl to Buffy & Beyond: Librarians in Pop Culture & Real Life",4/25/2015,13:00,4/25/2015,13:50,FALSE,"Librarians are everywhere -- in comics and literature, on tv and in the movies, and even at your actual library. What is the public fascination with librarians, and what's with the stereotypes? This presentation looks at representations of librarians in popular culture, discusses the bespectacled shushing 'Marian the librarian' trope, the 'sexy librarian' of pulp and porn, the disproportionate number of librarians in cozy mysteries, and the more recent 'librarian as mystical gatekeeper' device found in characters as diverse as Rupert Giles and the Librarian of Unseen University (ook!)
