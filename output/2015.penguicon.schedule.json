What is the public fascination with librarians, and what's with the stereotypes? This presentation looks at representations of librarians in popular culture, discusses the bespectacled shushing \"Marian the librarian\" trope, the \"sexy librarian\" of pulp and porn, the disproportionate number of librarians in cozy mysteries, and the more recent \"librarian as mystical gatekeeper\" device found in characters as diverse as Rupert Giles and the Librarian of Unseen University (ook!) Finally, we'll look at what actual librarians are doing these days, and how they might surprise you.",

Blues dance is an American idiom of partner dance that is freeform with limitless possibilities for creativity, including throwing out the partner bit and going solo. While blues dance gave rise to hip hop dancing, it also survives in modern culture as the awkward high school slow dance. Except real blues dance has more, well, pizzazz and a lot less awkwardness. No need for special shoes or a partner, comes as you are and we'll help you learn to groove.",
