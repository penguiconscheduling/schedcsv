Schow. It is essentially defined as literary horror with graphically described scenes of gore, that is generally extreme in nature. It was the most popular form of horror literature during the late 1980&rsquo;s and early 90&rsquo;s. Some of the most prominent splatterpunk writers included Poppy Z. Brite, Jack Ketchum, David Schow, Robert McCammon, John Skipp and Craig Spector, Joe R. Lansdale and Clive Barker.<br /> <br /> These authors held absolutely nothing back but, at the same time, their fiction can never be considered gore for the sake of gore. This wasn't just shock tactics without substance. No, these writers wanted to fuse extreme violence and horror (the 'splatter') with a confrontational social sensibility (the 'punk') to provide a more streetwise take on our collective fears of the time.<br /> <br /> Now, splatterpunk needs what every genre and sub-genre needs: new voices. Yes, it&rsquo;s a different world now but maybe more than ever in these extreme times we need writers who will push the boundaries, explore the taboo and the bizarre, the gruesome and morbid, and still have important messages to share with their readers.<br /> <br /> In this lecture, I will explore the rise and fall of splatterpunk; the resurgence in extreme horror fiction&rsquo;s popularity; and, of course, why we need splatterpunk now more than ever. <br /> <br />","","","","","","","TBA","1500 Town Center, Southfield, MI 48075","","Panel,possibly taking questions),Talk/Lecture (Single speaker discussing a topic","","","","Wishlist","",""

Drones are outfitted with a large number of sensors (cameras, accelerometers, gyros, etc.), and can continuously stream these signals in real time for analysis.<br /> <br /> This talk introduces the landscape of the various drone technologies that are currently available, and shows you how to acquire and analyze the real-time signals from the drones to design intelligent applications. We will demonstrate how to leverage machine learning models that perform real-time facial detection along with predictions of age, gender, emotion, and object recognition using the signals acquired from the drones. You will walk away understanding the basics of how to develop applications that utilize and visualize these real-time insights.<br /> <br /> This talk includes fun with drones, how to tackle the problem of world hunger, and some Game of Thrones silliness. It is targeted at data scientists, students, researchers, and IT professionals who have an interest in building intelligent applications using drones and machine learning. It will be a fun and exciting exploration as we demonstrate a drone with the power of recognizing faces, ages, genders, emotions, and objects.

I could probably do a 20 min power point then take questions, but that might not be a very dynamic panel. It might make for a better audience experience if I lead a panel discussion with other people who are working in citizen science, science pubs or programming at leisure science venues like aquariums, museums, parks or zoos. <br /> <br /> I am grad student in the Project Dragonfly program through Miami University and the Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Gardens. My grad school master plan involves improving science literacy and engagement with the general public, especially adults, through leisure learning venue programming. I have also done research into citizen science, and the science pub/cafe movement and have been involved in expanding the Science on Tap science pub in Cincinnati. <br /> <br /> One of the requirements for graduation form my program is taking a leadership role in bringing the results of our grad school work to the public. As someone who who enjoys a good Science Fiction Convention and has been involved in organizing a con for several years the first thing that came to mind for me when I was thinking about that requirement was doing a panel at a con. <br /> <br /> My husband has gone to Pengicon for a few years, and I went last year for the first time. I think my panel ideal would dovetail nicely with the hands on atmosphere of the programming I saw at your convention last year. <br /> <br />","Same as Legal Name","","","","","","TBA","1500 Town Center, Southfield, MI 48075","","Not Sure","","","","","",""

Even if you give them the best scroll ever, they will fail at their quest because they can't read magic. That is the situation we are all too often presenting our users with when we build software for the wrong persona. This session will be a hands-on workshop for anyone in the tech industry exploring how and why we can use personas in a meaningful way. To make it more tangible, we'll frame the concept of users as characters in an RPG. We'll center the lessons learned around a fictitious project, making it real and will include take-home materials. At then end of the workshop you'll have experienced how to effectively bring a human element to your project through character sheet personas.","Same as Legal Name","","","","","","TBA","1500 Town Center, Southfield, MI 48075","","Panel, Talk/Lecture (Single speaker discussing a topic, possibly taking questions)","","","","","",""
