After the medical tech industry kept promising a system to help automatically manage insulin for type 1 diabetic people and never delivering, some people got together to find ways to do it with the tech they already had. Over the past few years, a “closed-loop” system has been developed to algorithmically regulate people’s blood sugars. As a diabetic, the presenter built this system and saw her sugar values stabilize much more than would be possibly by managing them manually. Learn about OpenAPS (the open artificial pancreas system) and how it works, what problems it solves, and its safety and security concerns. The presenter will also share her personal experience and what OpenAPS means for her health now and in the future.

On one side, there are those who are blindly optimistic about technology. This attitude is sometimes termed “technosolutionism,” the naïve idea that every problem can be solved with technology. At the other extreme are those so critical of technology that they adopt an unrealistic Luddite attitude, avoiding technology altogether, or they assume that a dystopian future is inevitable and, as a result, become passive. Critical optimism navigates between these two extremes, encouraging an earnest hopefulness that also incorporates a healthy dose of criticality. What futures are possible, which are probable, and, most importantly, which might be preferred?","","","","","0","5","0","N","Charlevoix B","","","","","","","","","","","","6c71aad1c525604514f0ee5947066ae4","931344","Sophia Brueckner","","","","",""

Players acquire cards through a draft of sorts, and the Lords of the Abyss acquired on those cards grant special powers to the cardholder — but once you use the cards to acquire a location, that power is shut off, so players need to time their land grabs well in order to put themselves in the best position for when the game ends.","","","","","0","1","0","N","Gaming (TC's Room)","","","","","","","","","","","","71471206c6d2b527707256ed9ed4ac90","931386","The Wandering Meeple","","","","",""
