schedcsv

rewrite needed to clean up, have a data model, enable packaging, add tests, use templates,
easier to add functionality and output in different ways, debug the schedule

receives program schedule data
1. csv spreadsheet format
    - cleans data (right now it misses a lot of unicode characters that cause new lines or extra spaces
        and the code is messy)
    - sorts the data at one point but currently the program relies on the schedule being ordered correctly initially
2. database (not yet)

3. other programs python, maybe javascript?

outputs in several formats and parts (by room, by track, by presenter, 
in the future it'd be helpful to output to trifold program format as well)
