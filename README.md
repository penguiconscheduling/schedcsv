schedcsv
========

simple project with the goal of parsing a csv file from an export
from the head of programming and generating output files which are particularly useful to Penguicon 2014 (on the master branch).


current output:
   * custom xml for program book
   * list of speakers
   * list of speakers giving 3+ "hours" of talks ( an hour in this case is defined as 50 minutes...I think)
   * full output into a csv which google calendar should be able to import (works but seems to take a while to show up)
   * calendar views per track and one for the whole schedule (this last is not very useful in google calendar but should be useful for attendees)
   * output by room and speaker currently for dubugging but hopefully soon in a calendar importable csv format
