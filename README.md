schedcsv
========

simple project with the goal of parsing a csv file from an export
from the head of programming and generating output files which are particularly useful to Penguicon 2014 (on the master branch).


current output:
   * custom xml for program book
   * list of speakers
   * list of speakers giving 3+ "hours" of talks ( an hour in this case is defined as 50 minutes...I think)
   * full schedule output into a csv which google calendar is be able to import (difficult to use as so many events are at the same time)
   * schedule by track  in a (google or other ical) calendar importable csv format
   * schedule by speaker in a (google or other ical) calendar importable csv format
   * zip of all speakers calender importable csv files
   * schedule by room for dubugging
